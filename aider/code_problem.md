After reviewing the codebase, here are several potential issues and non-idiomatic React patterns:

 1 Inconsistent State Management:

 • The app mixes different state management approaches: Context API, URL state, and local component state
 • Consider consolidating state management using a more consistent pattern, possibly with React Query for server state and Context/URL state for UI state

 2 Prop Drilling in TelemetryVisualization:

 • The component receives many props that are passed through multiple levels
 • Consider using Context or composition to avoid prop drilling

 3 Non-Memoized Callbacks:

 • Many callback functions in components like SessionView and SessionControls are recreated on every render
 • Should use useCallback for performance optimization, especially for callbacks passed to child components

 4 Missing Error Boundaries:

 • No global error boundary implementation to gracefully handle runtime errors
 • Should implement ErrorBoundary components around major UI sections

 5 Inconsistent TypeScript Usage:

 • Some components lack proper TypeScript interfaces/types
 • Some any types are used where specific types could be defined
 • Missing return type annotations on some functions

 6 Non-Optimized Re-renders:

 • Missing useMemo for complex calculations (e.g., in SessionView)
 • Missing React.memo for purely presentational components

 7 Direct DOM Manipulation:

 • ChartJS integration could be better wrapped in a custom hook
 • Direct DOM access in chart components could be refactored to be more React-like

 8 Inconsistent Loading States:

 • Different loading state handling across components
 • Should standardize loading state UI patterns
