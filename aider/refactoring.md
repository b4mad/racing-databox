Here are the main issues and potential improvements for AnalysisView.tsx, with self-contained refactoring suggestions:

 1 State Management Complexity

 • There are multiple pieces of related state (lapsData, analysisData, loading, error) that could be consolidated
 • Recommendation: Create a custom hook useAnalysisState to encapsulate this related state and its logic

 2 Effect Dependencies and Loading Logic

 • The component has multiple useEffects with complex loading patterns
 • Loading session, landmarks, and telemetry data happens in separate effects
 • Recommendation: Create a useSessionLoader hook to handle the session and landmarks loading flow

 5 Telemetry Loading Logic

 • The telemetry loading effect is complex and handles multiple concerns
 • Recommendation: Extract to a separate useTelemetryLoader hook

 <!-- 3 Zoom State Management

 • Zoom state logic could be extracted to make the main component cleaner
 • Recommendation: Create a useZoomState hook to handle zoom-related state and operations -->

 <!-- 4 Error Handling

 • Error handling is scattered across different effects
 • Recommendation: Create a dedicated error handling utility or hook useAnalysisError -->


Each of these refactorings can be done independently and would make the code more maintainable and testable. The main component would then compose these hooks
together, making it easier to understand the high-level flow.

I recommend starting with creating useAnalysisState first because:

 1 It will establish the core state management pattern that the other hooks will build upon
 2 It will help identify which state and logic should be moved to the specialized loader hooks
 3 It provides a foundation for how the other hooks will interact with the shared state
 4 It will make the subsequent refactorings cleaner since we'll have a clear state management pattern

The general order should be:

 1 useAnalysisState - Consolidate core state management
 2 useSessionLoader - Handle session/landmarks loading using the state management pattern
 3 useTelemetryLoader - Handle telemetry loading using the established patterns

Would you like me to provide guidance on creating the useAnalysisState hook first?
